# Time Savers

Just a collection of old scripts I made for my job at Barracuda to help me be more lazy. Most of these used [Fabric](http://www.fabfile.org) because we hadn't adopted Ansible yet. These are mostly, if not totally, Python 2.7.

They have been sanitized of any sensitive information. Kept here for posterity and nostalgia.
